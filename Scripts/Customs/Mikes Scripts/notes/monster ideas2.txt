        }

        public override void Deserialize(GenericReader reader)
        {
            base.Deserialize(reader);
            int version = reader.ReadInt();
        }
    }

    public class FireEgg : BaseEgg
    {
        public override void Explode(Mobile target)
        {
            // Add fire effect and damage logic
            Effects.SendLocationParticles(EffectItem.Create(Location, Map, EffectItem.DefaultDuration), 0x3709, 10, 30, 2023);
            foreach (Mobile m in GetMobilesInRange(3))
            {
                if (m != this)
                {
                    m.Damage(20, this);
