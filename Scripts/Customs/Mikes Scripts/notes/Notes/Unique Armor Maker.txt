I would like you help making some unique armors for my RunUO server.  Below is an example of a basic unique armor.  To begin with it has a random hue and random armor rating.  It has 20 points of Cold Eater to absorb cold damage from the "AbsorptionAttributes" category.  It has self repair from the "ArmorAttributes" category.  It has two bonuses from the "attributes" category, bonusdex and bonusint which give bonues to their respective stats.  There is a bonus to Magic Resist from the "skillbonuses" category. Finally this item gives a +10 bonus to every category of resistance.  XmlLevelItem makes the item able to gain experiance, I want all of the unique armors to have this.  You can use an unlimited number of attributes and armorattributes when making the item.  You can have up to 5 separate skill bonuses.  You should remember to adjust the elemental resistances.  Below the armor is some refeneces for you, the basic armors in the game as well as all of the values that can go into each category.
