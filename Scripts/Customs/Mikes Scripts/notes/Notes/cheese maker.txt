I wold like your help making a RunUo Script for a RandomFancyCheese item.  I would be able to [add RandomFancyCheese and it would create a unique cheese for me.  The cheese should use random chosen graphic when spawned, either 0x097D or 0x097E.  It should have a random hue between 1-3000.  It should have a random name generated by combining two lists of cheese words.  Finally it should restore a random amount of hits stamina and mana.

When the characters eats the RandomFancyCheese there should be a message over their head saying they enjoyed the cheese.
