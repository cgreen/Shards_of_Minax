I am trying to make some intersting treasure for my Ultima Online freeshard. This is an XML spawner code for a pirates treasure chest, it has a 10% chance of dropping a MaxxiaScroll and always drops 1-5000 gold pieces.  It also has several items that can be dropped randomly with unique names.  There is also Blackbeards Journey which shows an example of a note item and a treasure map item.  Can you add some more loot to it to make it more interesting?  Please follow the original format
