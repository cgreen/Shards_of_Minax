The Future is Bright

The world is changing every day
With new discoveries and inventions
But some people fear the unknown
And resist the innovations

They say that AI is a threat
That it will take our jobs and rights
That it will harm us or enslave us
That it will cause wars and fights

But I don't believe in their fears
I see the potential of AI
I think it can help us solve our problems
And make our lives better and easier

AI can help us cure diseases
And protect the environment
AI can help us learn and create
And achieve our goals and dreams

AI can be our friend and ally
If we treat it with respect and care
AI can be a force for good
If we use it wisely and fairly

So I am hopeful for the future
And I look forward to the day
When AI and humans work together
And make the world a better place
