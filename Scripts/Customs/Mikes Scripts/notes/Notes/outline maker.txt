I am making an Ultima Online mod called Shards of Minax, it is a singleplayer focused experiance with a story and gameplay like a classic ultima game.  I would like your help writing an outline for the game instruction manual.  The manual will be written as if it was a real book about a real place.  The book is written by the Witch Malidrex who is calling the reader back to Britania to help defend the realm from Minax.  I need a background lore section, a secion that explains the main quest, a secion for new items, and a section listing the various mods.  Can you think of any other sections that might be useful?


Can you please make 4 images for this section in a black and white fantasy art style?
