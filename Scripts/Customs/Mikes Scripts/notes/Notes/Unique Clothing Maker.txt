I would like you help making some unique clothing for my RunUO server.  Below is an example of a basic unique clothing.  To begin with it has self repair from the "ClothingAttributes" category.  It has two bonuses from the "attributes" category, bonusdex and bonusint which give bonuses to their respective stats.  There is a bonus to Magic Resist and Swordsmanship from the "skillbonuses" category. Finally this item gives a +10 bonus to several resistances.  When making new items you can use an unlimited number of attributes and clothingattributes when making the item.  You can have up to 5 separate skill bonuses.  You should remember to adjust the elemental resistances.  Below the clothing is some references for you, the basic clothing in the game as well as all of the values that can go into each category.
