I am making an Ultima Online mod called Shards of Minax, it is a singleplayer focused experiance with a story and gameplay like a classic ultima game.  I would like your help writing an section of the manual.  The manual will be written as if it was a real book about a real place.  The book is written by the Witch Malidrex who is calling the reader back to Britania to help defend the realm from Minax.  The game is kind of an Isekai fantasy.  Below are the details of which section to write:

2. The History of Britannia and the Rise of Minax
   - A brief account of Britannia's glorious past.
   - The tale of Minax's ascent to power and the darkness she brought.  How she plans to unite all of the world shards so she can reassemble the gem of immortality and absorb it to enter the real world.  This will destroy all worlds.
   - The previous wars and encounters with Minax.
