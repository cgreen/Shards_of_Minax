I would like your help makeing XML Spawner codes for a cool unique treasure chest in my Ultima Online challenge world.  Below is an XML spawner code for Cyrus’s Treasure.  It has a variety of special named items, a random named magical weapon and armor (cyrus Sword and Armor) as well as a unique piecie of clothing, armor, and a unique weapon.  It has a 10% chance of dropping a MaxxiaScroll and always drops 1-5000 gold pieces.  Please keep the new chest in the same format, all one line.  Please try to give all of the items unique names and hues, and select different base items fomr the original example.  I would like a new chest with a history of Zimbabwe theme.
