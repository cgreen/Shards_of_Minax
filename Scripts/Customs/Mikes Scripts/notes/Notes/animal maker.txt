I would like your help creating a set of XML codes (see below for example) to spawn new unique tamable monsters for my Ultima Online free shard challenge.  Below is an example of using a BrownBear to make a unique monster called Aries Bear with the special ability BleedAttack.  Can you make a bunch more using the Golem as a base?  They should have unique stats and one ability to go with their name/hue.  Please keep the loot the same for each one, a MaxxiaScroll.  Please give the new monsters a made up very unususal name reminicent of a Jack Vance creature, make up new words that don't exist.  These are the xmlweaponability:

ArmorIgnore
BleedAttack
ConcussionBlow
CrushingBlow
Disarm
Dismount
DoubleStrike
InfectiousStrike
MortalStrike
MovingShot
ParalyzingBlow
ShadowStrike
WhirlwindAttack
