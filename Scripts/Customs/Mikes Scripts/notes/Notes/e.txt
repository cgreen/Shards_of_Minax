I need you help combining the contents of two text files.  Lets say I have TextA and TextB, I would like some method for combining both of these files such that the new fil has the text TextA and on each line the corrisponding text from TextB.  For example:

<TextA Line1><TextB Line1>
<TextA Line2><TextB Line2>
<TextA Line3><TextB Line3>
<TextA Line4><TextB Line4>
.....continuing until the end of TextA

I have NotePad++ and Powershell but I can use something else if that is needed
