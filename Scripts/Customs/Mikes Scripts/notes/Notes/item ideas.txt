That sounds like a fun and challenging project. I'm glad you are using RunUO to create your own shard. RunUO is a project to create and maintain a freely available Microsoft .NET based Ultima Online game server¹. You can use C# programming language to develop plugins and modifications for RunUO¹. There are many resources for learning C# development for RunUO, such as the RunUO Wiki³⁴ and the Shard Portal².
